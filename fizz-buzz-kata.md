#The fizz-buzz kata

So what is a kata and what is this all about?

Read all about it here and here:
  * http://codekata.com/
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_%28programming%29

But above all get going.

Use TDD, test driven development, to complete the fizz-buzz kata. You will be using NodeJS (Javascript on the command line) 
and Mocha (a unit testing framework for Javascript).


## Setup

Do this Kata using:
  * NodeJs http://nodejs.org/
  * Mocha http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/

You can install NodeJS and npm (node package manager) using apt-get.

 sudo apt-get install nodejs
 sudo apt-get install npm
 
Install mocha using npm:



## What to do

See the details of the kata here:
    http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/fizz-buzz/
    
 Create 2 files: 
   * fizz-buzz.js
   * fizz-buzz.test.js
    
Use the first file for your katas code and the second for unit tests. The idea with TDD is that you write your tests first and then the code for your program next. Feel free to brush up on TDD using google.
    
## Once done

Once you are done commit your kata's code to the Kata Wall of Fame.
